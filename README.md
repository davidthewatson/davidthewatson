# I'm Dave. 

## I'm working on:

* [Cobind Desktop](https://rubenerd.com/p1191/) 2.0 by [extending Cosmic Desktop](https://system76.com/cosmic/).
* Making [doc](https://github.com/davidthewatson/doc) on [bun](https://bun.sh/)
* Working on Minecraft Bedrock extensions

## Why?

* Because [blocks world is legit CS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks_world)
* So are [voxels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) from medical imaging to minecraft
* Bun, rust, and zig: like-minded programming languages are our polyglot future
* Human-computer education with oversight from cradle to grave, not mediated social ~~experience~~ 
* Human-computer sensemaking from peek and poke to AI: [Peter Pirolli](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/180918-conference/presentations/20-3_07_Pirolli.pdf)
