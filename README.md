## I'm Dave.

I lived in Boston and Seattle before settling in Pittsburgh.

I loved software when it was two guys in a garage or small powers of two in an old, urban warehouse.

Now it's me and an AI code pair on a literate programming unicycle, human-computer sensemaking, nimble lab experiments.

You may have spotted me among my neurotribe at:

* CA, CAT, or CMU from Peoria to Pittsburgh
* Platinum from Boston to Seattle
* Legent (after Duquesne, aka a [software company](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/471066-85#overview), a [university](https://duq.edu/), AND a [fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Duquesne)) from Pittsburgh 
* MAYA before BCG (after Cobind Linux)
* Mellon before BNY 
* USS before Nippon 
* [Catapult PGH](http://catapultpgh.org/) (where some of my best friends worked [alone together](https://www.sherryturkle.com/alone-together))
