# I'm Dave.

I loved software when software was two guys in a garage or small powers of two (humans - a pair) in an old, urban warehouse.

Now it's me and an AI code pair on a literate programming unicycle, human-computer sensemaking, nimble lab experiments, surveilled only by my DiY software, because federated k8s behind the firewall is the new normal.

A stunt monkey whose lizard brain keeps him running, soulful self and shouldered bike cross-town, to meet friends for coffee near The University, much like The Corporation is still a friend, albeit a dark, masked, _evil_ one.

As if there were only one (behavioral deterinant), where the monkey starts screaming, barely masking the Doc Brown emeritus shadow.

Finally, the PFC takes over and, along with the bicameral, is firmly in charge for the length of the dissertation while the 3 x 2 models of cognition scaling to a [brain cubic model of chess](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05004-4) collapse.
