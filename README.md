## I'm Dave - a software guy from Pittsburgh.

I was lucky that my mother's employer had the money and the good sense to afford a DEC PDP-11 when those old Unix dorm refrigerators cost a hundred grand before they were deprecated and replaced by linux boxes in slow motion.

That old Unix box, plus my mother's decades-ahead-of-its-time WFH arrangement, which included an IBM PC XT that would run DOS and later Windows, was the bedrock of my education. I'd *borrow* that PC in the evenings and weekends to hack and learn on DR-DOS and the like. 

That old DEC would jump-start my career in computer science, along with my trusty Atari ST.

The Atari ST, in particular, was just a poor man's Macintosh at the time, and it ran much of the same software from programming languages to MIDI.

My open source work began around Y2K, most likely on a plane between Boston, Seattle, and Pittsburgh.  Twenty years later, the documentation in section 6.1 on page 19 still mentions [my boilerplate servlet](https://xmlrpc.sourceforge.net/documentation.pdf) as if that were innovation.
