## I'm Dave - a software developer in Pittsburgh.

Computers were the third and mostly final stop in my STEM journey assembling small pieces, loosely joined from a public school education in the United States.

That education arose from the fact that my mom managed more than one medical practice and my dad managed a chemistry lab which meant that by the time I got to those subjects in high school, I'd already worn the STEM T-shirt proudly in a basement lab that looked like the remnants of an old Fisher Scientific catalog.

By the time I got to those STEM classes in high school, it was no wonder I had trouble understanding why i was there.

And then I disovered computers. Or computers discovered me, since they didn't exist outside a research lab until then. 

Hence, I was lucky that my mother's employer had the money and the good sense to afford a DEC PDP-11 before those old Unix dorm refrigerators had gone out of fashion.

That old Unix box, plus my mother's decades-ahead-of-its-time WFH arrangement which included an IBM PC XT that would run DOS and later Windows, was the unforeseen key to my education. I'd *borrow* that PC in the evenings and weekends to hack and learn. 

That old DEC cost somewhere near $100K but would jump-start my career in computer science, along with my trusty Texas Insturments TI-99/4A and Atari ST, both of which wouldn't top a thousand dollars.

My open source work began around Y2K, most likely on a plane between Boston, Seattle, and Pittsburgh.  Twenty years later, the documentation in section 6.1 on page 19 still mentions [my boilerplate contribution](https://xmlrpc.sourceforge.net/documentation.pdf).
