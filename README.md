## I'm Dave.

I loved software when it was two guys in a garage or small powers of two in an old, urban warehouse.

Now it's me and an AI code pair on a literate programming unicycle, human-computer sensemaking, nimble lab experiments.

You may have spotted me at:

* CAT from Peoria to Pittsburgh
* CMU all over Campus from Newell-Simon to Gates, Tepper to Wean, Heinz to Mehrabian.
* MAYA Design before BCG
* [Cobind Linux](https://rubenerd.com/p1191/)
* [Catapult PGH](http://catapultpgh.org/) (where some of my best friends worked [alone together](https://www.sherryturkle.com/alone-together))
